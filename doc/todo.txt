Some things on the TODO list:

Need to need to fix the Django admin screen so that when creating a
flashcard, we can pick a flashcard list to associate it with.  

Something to think of: In the admin screen, should creating a
FlashcardList automatically get associated with the currently logged-in
user?

Verify these two in the REST api web views:
1) Need to fix the relationship between users and flashcard lists
2) Need to fix the relationship between flashcard lists and flashcards.


- Need to build up the front end UI with django templating.
